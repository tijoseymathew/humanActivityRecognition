# Human Activity Recognition

This repository cleans the data described at  http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones to produce a .csv file containing the combined training and testing data with only the mean and standard deviation of each time window extracted. 
A summary data frame 'summData' is also created to extract the average value of each of the features for each subject and activity.
